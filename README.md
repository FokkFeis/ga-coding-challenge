#### NOTES

This app was put together quickly as a coding challenge.  If this were a real applications the following would be needed, but are not shown in this project for the sake of being timely
- Modular seperation of concerns.  A well written app would have a much better directory/file structure that would help an engineer navigate the source more efficiently.
- Better error and edge case handling.  This app is very "optimistic" in its execution, but to be ready for actual users there are a lot of edge cases and error handling that should be added.
- Deployment optimization.  Though not necessary it would be beneficial to our users if the code was optimized and streamlined using Webpack or other "packaging" build systems.
- Loading messages when data is being loaded from Web APIs. So the user has feedback that their request is being handled.
